         Packaging specifications such as Java Archives (JAR) and Enterprise Archives (EAR) are standard mechanisms for 
         declaring a collection of Classes and resources into one unit.  Often these are intended to be run directly or 
         deployed into a web or application server.  Archives carry with them implicit metadata regarding their structure, 
         from which concerns like ClassLoading scope and manifest parameters may be inferred.

         However useful, archives typically require the addition of a build step within the development lifecycle, 
         either via a script or extra tool.  The ShrinkWrap project provides a simple API to declaratively assemble 
         archives in code, optionally allowing for export into ZIP or Exploded File formats.  This makes it very fast
         to prototype "virtual" archives from resources scattered about the classpath, the filesystem or remote URLs.
